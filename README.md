# Cognify- The interactive platform with an AI tutor that actually helps you revise.

As a student, staring at 50-page PDFs is exhausting. We wanted a study tool that felt like a real conversation, not just another text box. We built Cognify to turn dense reading material into an interactive voice tutor that actually talks back and helps you learn.

Cognify is an AI-powered voice study assistant built with React and Google Gemini. Simply upload a PDF, and Cognify instantly extracts the text, auto-generates a dynamic chapter syllabus, and allows you to talk to your study material via voice commands for a hands-free, conversational learning experience.

To test, go to the frontend folder and run `npm install` and `npm run dev`
